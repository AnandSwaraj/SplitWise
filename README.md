The main focus of this app is to design a payment graph(who owes to whom and how much) and to minimize the number of transactions.

The approach involves taking the largest positive and negative balances and eliminating them by making a transaction between them.

The data structure used is a heap, and the greedy approach is used(Though it is not optimal, but works for our case and is simple to code).
